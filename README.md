## Inspiration: 
Our inspiration for this project stems from the past struggles our team has with the process of registration.  The goal of this project was to simplify that stressful process.

## What it does: 
 It eliminates the need to constantly switch between Course Registration and Rate My Professor.

## How we built it: 
For the front end we used html, css, and javascript to interact with the course registration website and identify professors to find ratings for. For the backend we used express.js to make API calls to the Rate My Professor Website. On the front end we used fetch calls to access our local server and fully integrate the professor information functionality.

## Challenges we ran into
The Rate My Professor API was not compatible with Google Chrome Extensions so we had to host it locally and create two separate processes to achieve our goal.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
We are really proud that we have a functioning product. With half of our team begin first time hackers, we did not know what to expect, however despite the challenges, we were able to hack together a product that we are all proud of.

## What we learned
None of us had really ever spent time working with java script, and since our project was almost entirely in javas script we certainly had a great learning experience.

## What's next for TAMU REGISTRATION HELPER
We had wished to be able to also implement the grade distribution data from the TAMU annex page, we are looking forward to continuing the development of this tool in the near future.
